:role-uri-prefix: https://github.com/jirutka/ansible-role

This role installs https://owncloud.org[ownCloud] on Gentoo Linux, configures it to run on PHP-FPM in a chroot environment (to minimize security risks), with PostgreSQL database and nginx as a reverse proxy.

Initial admin user is “root” with password “root”.
